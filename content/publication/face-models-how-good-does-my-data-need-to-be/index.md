abstract: Face models are widely used in image processing and other domains. The
  input data to create a 3D face model ranges from accurate laser scans to
  simple 2D RGB photographs. System designers must choose a source of input data
  and then choose a reconstruction method to obtain a usable 3D face. If a
  particular application domain requires accuracy X, which kinds of input data
  are suitable? This paper takes a step toward answering this question. A
  variety of common input data types such as 2D landmarks and 3D scans are
  constructed from an existing high quality dataset. A morphable face model is
  then used to reconstruct 3D faces. By comparing to ground truth, an analysis
  of the relative error between different data types is obtained.
summary: 'We have quantified and analyzed the base-line reconstruction accuracy of a face model as a function of source
data type commonly used in the domain.'
