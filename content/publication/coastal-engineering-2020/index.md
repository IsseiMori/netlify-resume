abstract: This paper presents a machine learning approach for the automatic
  identification of rip currents with breaking waves. Rip currents are dangerous
  fast moving currents of water that result in many deaths by sweeping people
  out to sea. Most people do not know how to recognize rip currents in order to
  avoid them. Furthermore, efforts to forecast rip currents are hindered by lack
  of observations to help train and validate hazard models. The presence of web
  cams and smart phones have made video and still imagery of the coast
  ubiquitous and provide a potential source of rip current observations. These
  same devices could aid public awareness of the presence of rip currents. What
  is lacking is a method to detect the presence or absence of rip currents from
  coastal imagery. This paper provides expert labeled training and test data for
  rip currents. We use Faster R-CNN and a custom temporal aggregation stage to
  make detections from still images or videos with higher measured accuracy than
  both humans and other methods of rip current detection previously reported in
  the literature.
